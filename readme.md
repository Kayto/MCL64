# MCL64 Kayto Revisions
## Revision 4
**Date:** August 04, 2025  
**Updated:** August 07, 2025
**Original Code Modified by:** kayto@github.com
**Base:** Revision 3 (12/10/2021)

Revision 4 represents my refactoring of the MCL64 codebase to simplify ongoing development and add compile-time acceleration control.

```
// Revision 4 08/03/2025 by Kayto@github.com
// Refactored code to split out the following files:
// - opcodes.cpp/h
// - opcode_dispatch.cpp/h
// - basic_rom.c/h
// - kernal_rom.c/h
// - addressing_modes.cpp/h
// - hardware_config.cpp/h
// 
// Updated 08/07/2025 Added compile-time acceleration control:
// - ENABLE_ACCELERATION define allows complete removal of acceleration code
// - All acceleration-related code wrapped in #if ENABLE_ACCELERATION blocks
// - When set to 0, forces cycle-accurate mode and removes internal RAM array
// - resulting in improved cartridge compatibility
// 
```
 Compatibility related to real C64 carts, specifically EF3, Action Replay and Supersnapshot freezer cartridges is improved by compile time removal of acceleration.

### Compatibility Notes

- Please note that your situation may vary depending on your hardware and this only represents my comparison. 
- Try the original code first!


| Cartridge Type | REV4 Status | Original MCL64 REV3 Status |

* (1) this may be normal behaviour on real hardware.
* (2) TBC - possibly intermittent - is my board a bit flakey!
