# MCL64 Kayto Revisions
## Revision 4
**Date:** August 03, 2025
**Original Code Modified by:** kayto@github.com
**Base:** Revision 3 (12/10/2021)

Revision 4 represents my refactoring of the MCL64 codebase to simplify ongoing development. No code changes other than moving the large opcodes, ROMs, addressing modes, and hardware configuration sections into seperate files.

# MCL64 Kayto Revision Development

See DEV folders for revisions under development and associated notes. This represents a work in progress area, pending merge into last revision.

## Revision 5

**Date:** August, 2025
**Original Code Modified by:** kayto@github.com
**Base:** Revision 4 

Revision 5 represents a work in progress snapshot of my development of the MCL64 codebase with the aim to gain better understanding of compatibility related to real C64 carts, such as EF3, Action Replay and Supersnapshot freezer cartridges. I am not there yet, but steadily improving seems like a result.

##### Compatibility Notes

###### Known Working

- Please note that your situation may vary depending on your hardware and this only represents my comparison. 
- Try the original code first!

* (1) this may be normal behaviour on real hardware.
* (2) TBC - possibly intermittent - is my board a bit flakey!

###### Potential Issues

* All things timings!
